# Stack Overflow Analysis
 
First real ML project on Github, all about classifying stack overflow data into one of 3 categories. Turns out moving from enviornment to enviornment teaches you a lot about the various benefits of each, and that Tensorflow works well in certain cases, but kind of terrible here. Sklearn was very handy in creating a final product, which ended up being less complex than the previous versions.
